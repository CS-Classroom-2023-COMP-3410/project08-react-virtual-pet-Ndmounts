This should work out of the box, this is a locally hosted app that should
come with npm from the get go

To get started first run

npm install

if there are errors during that, run

npm fund

and follow any instructions it gives you.

After that simply run

npm run dev

and follow the link to run.



This is a simple web app that simulates taking care of a pet in your browser.

There are 4 options to take care of your pet that affect their stats in different ways

Generally there are no ways to lose, but don't let your bond get too low...

There are 9 achievements affected by both the stats and age of your pet, try to unlock them all!

You can view these achievements using the nav bar at the top of the screen.

Have fun!
